# Blogdown allows you to create new two kinds of R Markdown posts that 
# are knittable:
#   
#   .Rmd üß∂ to .html or
# 
# .Rmarkdown üß∂ to .markdown
# 
# Once knitted, both are then previewable in your Hugo site.
# 
# I used to agonize over which file extension to use. But now I am squarely 
# in .Rmarkdown camp with Ma√´lle- I like knitting to .markdown and wish this 
# was easier in blogdown; see: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/530

# A rule that is true 90% of the time: folders in content/ are singular,

# If you look in your Files pane, you can see that this creates a folder 
# with the date and the ‚Äúslug‚Äù name of my post ("hi-hugo"). 
# The actual R Markdown file is named index.Rmarkdown.
       
# This is a Hugo page bundle. Each post gets its own bundle, or folder. 
# Inside the post bundle is where all your static images, static data 
# files like .csv files should go.

# In the post itself, use the relative file path like:
# ![my-first-image](image1.jpg)


# Let‚Äôs look at the index.Rmarkdown. We‚Äôll knit this .Rmarkdown to 
# a .markdown file. You may knit freely now in blogdown!
# To knit an .Rmarkdown post, you can either:
# Use the Knit button to knit to the correct output format, or
# Use the keyboard shortcut Cmd+Shift+K (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+K (Windows/Linux).
